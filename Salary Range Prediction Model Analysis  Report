2. Methodology
 2.1 Feature Engineering
 
1. Numeric Features Created:
   - skills_count: Number of required skills
   - benefits_count: Number of offered benefits
   - description_length: Length of job description
   - experience_range: Range of required experience
   - skills_benefits_interaction: Interaction between skills and benefits
   - size_experience_interaction: Interaction between company size and experience

2. Categorical Features Processed:
   - Experience
   - Qualifications
   - Work Type

2.2 Preprocessing Pipeline
1. Numeric Features:
   - RobustScaler for handling outliers
   - Applied to all engineered numeric features

2. Categorical Features:
   - OneHotEncoder with drop='first'
   - Applied to categorical variables

2.3 Model Selection
Two models were implemented and compared:
1. Gradient Boosting Regressor
2. Random Forest Regressor (final choice)

3. Model Performance
 3.1 Random Forest Model Metrics
- Mean Absolute Error: $6.47K
- Root Mean Squared Error: $7.53K
- Cross-validation R² scores showed consistent performance
- Model explains moderate variance in salary predictions

3.2 Feature Importance
Top influencing features:
1. Company Size
2. Experience Range
3. Description Length
4. Skills Count
5. Work Type

4. Key Findings
1. Salary Determinants:
   - Company size has the strongest correlation with salary
   - Experience requirements show significant impact
   - Job description length correlates with salary level

2. Market Insights:
   - Balanced distribution of work types suggests diverse job market
   - Similar qualification requirements across salary ranges
   - Skills count has moderate impact on salary predictions

5. Recommendations
1. Model Improvements:
   - Consider implementing non-linear feature transformations
   - Explore deep learning approaches for complex pattern recognition
   - Add industry-specific feature engineering

2. Data Collection:
   - Gather more detailed skills information
   - Include industry-specific metrics
   - Add regional cost-of-living adjustments

3. Application:
   - Implement confidence intervals for predictions
   - Add explainability features for individual predictions
   - Consider developing separate models for different job categories

6. Limitations
1. Data Constraints:
   - Limited variation in benefits count
   - Potential regional salary differences not fully captured
   - Categorical variable encoding may lose some nuanced information

2. Model Constraints:
   - Moderate R² score indicates unexplained variance
   - Limited ability to capture complex interaction effects
   - May not generalize well to extreme salary ranges
3. Experience:
  - as This was my first time training ML model I had a hard time working on such a large dataset and because my laptop was slow in trainig the model

7. Conclusion
The implemented salary prediction model provides moderate accuracy in predicting job salaries based on available features. While the model shows promise in capturing general salary trends, there's room for improvement through additional feature engineering and alternative modeling approaches. The analysis provides valuable insights into salary determinants in the job market, which can be useful for both employers and job seekers.
